High-Level Design Plan:

1. Image Upload and Object Detection:
   - Implement image upload functionality using Streamlit.
   - Integrate an object detection model to identify clothing items in the uploaded image. (e.g., YOLO or ResNet50) 
   - Extract individual clothing items from the image based on detected bounding boxes.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Use ResNet50 to extract features from each detected clothing item.

3. Recommendation System:
   - Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find similar items for each detected piece of clothing.

4. User Interface:
   - Display the uploaded image.
   - Show a combobox populated with detected clothing items.
   - Allow users to select one or more items from the combobox.
   - Implement a "Search for recommendation" button.
   - Display 5-6 recommended images for each selected item.

5. Backend Processing:
   - Process user selections and trigger the recommendation system for chosen items.
   - Fetch and prepare recommended images for display.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the components and their interactions:

1. Image Upload and Object Detection Module:
   - Function: upload_and_detect(image)
   - Input: User-uploaded image
   - Output: List of detected clothing items with their bounding boxes

2. Feature Extraction Module:
   - Function: extract_features(cropped_image)
   - Input: Cropped image of a single clothing item
   - Output: Feature vector

3. Recommendation System Module:
   - Function: get_recommendations(feature_vector, n_recommendations=6)
   - Input: Feature vector of a clothing item
   - Output: List of similar item images

4. User Interface Module (Streamlit):
   - Components:
     - Image upload widget
     - Display area for uploaded image
     - Combobox for selecting detected items
     - "Search for recommendation" button
     - Display area for recommended items

5. Main Application Flow:
   a. User uploads an image
   b. System detects clothing items and displays the image
   c. Combobox is populated with detected items
   d. User selects item(s) and clicks "Search for recommendation"
   e. System processes each selected item:
      - Extracts features
      - Finds similar items using KNN
      - Displays recommendations

This high-level design incorporates the object detection step and allows users to select specific items from the uploaded image for recommendations. It maintains the core functionality of the original plan while adding the ability to handle multiple clothing items in a single image.
